The scene depicts a Mediterranean landscape set in a river valley of the inland Iberian Peninsula during the Neolithic period. The environment reflects the typical Mediterranean vegetation, including holm oaks, oak trees, and shrubs. The landscape shows a mosaic of forests and small cereal fields, with more emphasis on the dense forest. In the foreground, a group of five people is working in the fields, harvesting wheat using wooden and flint sickles. The group consists of three men and two women, all dressed in prehistoric brown wool and linen garments, appropriate for the period. In the background, there is a small flock of black goats and brown sheep, which are being watched over by an elderly woman and a child, both holding wooden staffs.
